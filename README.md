# RAT
ROMS Analytical Toolbox

A collection of MATLAB scripts for some comprehensive analysis of ROMS-AGRIF / CROCO outputs.

Developed during my PhD at the Department of Oceanography at the Nelson Mandela University.
I am in the process of cleaning up the code and will commit it as it is completed.
